Select the pulse site and assist the patient in a comfortable position,sitting or lying.<br>4. Radial artery is commonly used unless is impalpable.<br>While taking pulse,keep the arms resting over the chest or on the side with the palm facing downward.<br>In sitting position,keep the arms resting over the thigh with the palm facing downward.<br>5. Palpate and check the pulse.<br><b>Place the pads of the three middle fingers over the artery,just slightly on the pulse site.<br>After establishing the pulse,start feeling the pulse,count the beats for one whole minute (rate) using the second hand wrist watch or pulse-meter.<br>Assess the volume and force of pulse.<br>Assess the rhythm and tension of arterial resistance.</b><br>6. Document findings.<br>7. Pulse should be taken at the same time with respirations and temperature.<br>8. Clear way,wash hands and reassure the patient and ensure comfort.<br><br><b>Respiration</b><br>This is the exchange of gases between the lungs and the atmosphere.It consists of inspiration (taking in oxygen),expiration (releasing out carbondioxide) and a pause.The number of times a patient breathes in and out per minute is called <b>Rate.</b></b><br>The normal rates are as follows;<br><b>New born babies 30-44 per minute<br>Children 20-30 per minute<br>Adult 16-20 per minute<br>Note: Slightly quicker in women than men.</b><br><br><b>Requirements</b><br>Tray (as for observation tray)<br><br><b>Procedure</b><br>1. After taking pulse,maintain the fingers over the radial artery.<br><b>Note the rise and fall of the patient's chest with each inspiration and expiration.<br>Count respiration for one minute noting the rate,rhythm,regularity and depth.<br></b>2. Wash hands.<br>3. Record findings and report any abnormalities detected.<br>3. Clear away and thank the patient.<br><br><b>Blood pressure</b><br>This is the force exerted by blood on the walls of arteries as it's been pumped by the heart.<br><br><b>Requirements</b><br>As for observation tray.<br><b>Note: A sphygmomanometer and stethoscope a must.</b><br><br><b>Procedure</b><br>1. Ensure that the patient has not taken coffee,smoked and done any activity such as heavy exercise within 30 minutes prior to the procedure.<br>2. Put the patient at rest,preferably in bed,legs not crossed and make sure there is no tight clothing around the arm.<br>3. Select a cuff of appropriate size and make sure the equipment is functional.<br>4. Select an appropriate arm,supported at the level of the heart and palm of the hand facing upwards.<br>Palpate the location of the brachial artery at the elbow by pressing the pads of the three middle fingers over it.<br>5. Remove garments or sleeve above the area where the cuff will be placed and expose the brachial artery.<br>6. Apply the sphygmomanometer cuff evenly and firmly around the patient's arn,above the elbow at approximately 2.5 cm above the point where brachial artery can be palpated.<br>7. Place the earpieces in the ears,directing them forward into the canal and not against the ear itself slightly tilted forward as the tubes are hanging freely.<br>8. Inflate the cuff slowly,pulse sounds heard during this phase will fade and then disappear.<br>9. Continue inflating the cuff about 30 millimeters of mercury above this point.<br>10. Slowly release the pressure using the knob at the side of the bulb.<br>11. At a certain point the pulse will be heard,note the point on the gauge and this number is recorded as the systolic pressure.<br>12. As the pressure continues to fall,the sound completely disappears,note this point and this number is recorded as the diastolic pressure.<br>13. Deflate cuff completely,slowly until when the beat fades away,disconnect he tubing and remove cuff from the patient's arm.<br>14. Report immediately any difficulties in interpreting results and repeat procedure after one minute if there is any doubt about the reading.<br>15. Leave the patient comfortable.<br>16. Remove equipment,clean earpiece with a spirit swab,remove gloves,wash and dry hands.<br>17. Record the readings as systolic over diastolic in mmHg and report any abnormality.<br><br>";
